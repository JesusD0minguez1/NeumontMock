            <p>The tech industry is exploding with career opportunities at companies throughout the nation. According to The Bureau of Labor Statistics, there will be an estimated 598,700 new jobs added in computer and information technology occupations from 2018-2028. And the National Center for Education Statistics reports there were only 88,736 computer science graduates in 2020 to help fill those jobs. Add to that an average starting salary of $76,000 a year for a computer science grad,* and it's clear that a degree from Neumont can lead to a rewarding job in the field of computer science. After all, what good is a college education if it doesn't launch your career?
